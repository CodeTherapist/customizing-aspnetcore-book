# Requirements

There are some little requirements to run the demos. 

Since .NET Core is cross platform, the demos should run on Mac and various Linux distributions as well, but I never tried it.

First of all, you'll find all the demos in this repository on GitHub:
https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/customizing-aspnetcore

## Tools

It would make sense to have Git installed on your machine to get the sources. On the other hand GitHub allows you to download a repository as a ZIP file. Git would be the better choice to get updates of the demos more easily.

Some demos are written in ASP.NET Core 2.2 but most of them in ASP.NET Core 3.0. So you should download the .NET Core 2.2 SDK as well as the .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

> While writing that book .NET Core 3.0 preview6 was released.

Both version can be downloaded on https://dotnet.microsoft.com/

I use Visual Studio Code to demonstrate and to edit the sources of the demos. You could do it the same way or by using Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio for Mac should work as well, but I never tried it myself and I cannot really support it.

Visual Studio Code can be downloaded on https://code.visualstudio.com/ and should work on Mac and Linux as well.

I also use .NET Command Line Interface a lot in this book. This means you need any console, shell, bash or terminal that can execute the .NET CLI. To test it, just type `dotnet --info` in the console of your choice. I prefer cmder to work with.

You can download cmder on https://cmder.net/

## Knowledge

To follow the demos, you should already know ASP.NET Core a little bit, because I'm not going to explain ASP.NET Core in this book. You should understand the concepts of ASP.NET Core and know the main files of a new ASP.NET Core project.

This is also not a book about .NET Core in general and it is not a C# book. So you should be familiar with C# and .NET, but not necessarily with .NET Core.
