# Preface

This is not a planned book. In the last year I wrote a blog post series about customizing APS.NET Core in my blog on https://asp.net-hacker.rocks and one day I got asked to bundle that series to a book. 

This idea wasn't that bad. I always thought about to write a book and last year I started to write a book about ASP.NET Core and React with a collogue of mine. Working with a publisher didn't work well. So I played around with self publishing platforms and ended up with LeanPup.

Now I'm going to try to pack the blog series into a book. Also to try LeanPup in a real scenario. At the end it was pretty fast to copy all the blog posts into this book. Including the images I got an edition with 77 pages . Not that bad.

But there was still some more work to do:

1. Links to the blog posts series needed to be removed or rewritten.
2. Some texts are written to be on a blog, mentioning "this post", "previous post"and so on. This needed to be rewritten as well.
3. Code listings needed to be reformatted, because I allow horizontal scrolling on my blog for long lines of code. This won't work well in a book.
4. Some of the contents of the blog series are a little bit outdated, because they are basing on older or current .NET Core versions. Since .NET Core 3.0 will be launched in September this year (2019) I needed to rewrite some posts to match the upcoming version.

I decided not to change my personal language, my style of writing. Even if it is a more a casual language, than you may used to read in books like this. So the contents of that book are more or less the same as on the blog on https://asp.net-hacker.rocks.

Even if all the contents are on my blog, I hope you will find this book useful and worth to read. And maybe it is worth to pay for as well.
