# Preface

This is not a planned book. During 2018 I wrote a blog post series about customizing APS.NET Core in my blog on https://asp.net-hacker.rocks and one day I got asked to bundle that series to a book. 

This idea wasn't that bad. I always thought about writing a book one day and last year I started to write a book about ASP.NET Core and React with a friend. But  working with a publisher did not work that well. So I played around with self publishing platforms and ended up with LeanPup.

Now I'm going to try to pack the blog series into a book. And I'm going to try LeanPup in a real scenario. At the end it was pretty fast to copy all the blog posts into this book. Including the images I got an edition with 77 pages. Not that bad, isn't it?

But there was still some more work to do:

1. Links to the blog posts series needed to be removed or rewritten.
2. Some texts are written to be on a blog, mentioning "this post", "previous post" and so on. This needed to be rewritten as well.
3. Code listings needed to be reformatted, because I allow horizontal scrolling on my blog for long lines of code. This won't work well in a book.
4. Some of the contents of the blog series are a little bit outdated, because they are based on older or current .NET Core versions. Since .NET Core 3.0 will be launched in September 2019 I needed to rewrite some posts to match the upcoming version.

I decided not to change my personal language, my style of writing. Even if it is rather a more casual language, than you may used to read in books like this. So the content of this book is more or less the same as on the blog on https://asp.net-hacker.rocks.

Even if all the content is on my blog, I hope you will find this book useful and worth to read. And maybe it is worth to pay for as well.
