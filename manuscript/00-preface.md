# Preface

This is not a planned book. In the last year I wrote a blog post series about customizing APS.NET Core in mz blog on https://asp.net-hacker.rocks and one day I got asked to bundle that series to a book. 

This idea wasn't that bad and now I'm going to try this. At the end it was pretty fast to copy all the blog posts into this book. Including the images I got an edition with 77 pages . Not that bad.

But there was still some work to do:

1. Links to the blog posts series needed to be removed or rewritten.
2. Some texts are written be on a blog, mentioning "this post" and so on. This needed to be rewritten as well.
3. Code listings needed to be reformatted, because I allow horizontal scrolling on my blog for long lines of code.
4. Some of the contents of the blog series are a little bit outdated, because they are basing on older or current .NET Core versions. Since .NET Core 3.0 will be launched in September this year (2015) I needed to rewrite some posts to match the upcoming version.

I decided not to change my personal language, my style of writing. Even if it is a more a casual language, than you may used to read in books like this.

Even if all the contents are on my blog, I hope you will find this book useful and worth to read. And maybe it is worth to pay for as well.
